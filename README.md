## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.


### Dataset
For this project we will use the Storm Events Database from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Storm Events Database contains the records used to create the official NOAA Storm Data publication, documenting:
- The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce;
- Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area; and
- Other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with another event.
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/

The database currently contains data from January 1950 to November 2024, as entered by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS). Due to changes in the data collection and processing procedures over time, there are unique periods of record available depending on the event type. NCEI has performed data reformatting and standardization of event types but has not changed any data values for locations, fatalities, injuries, damage, narratives and any other event specific information. Please refer to the Database Details page for more information.

As we can see in the image above, the following events were recorded:
1. Tornado: From 1950 through 1954, only tornado events were recorded.

2. Tornado, Thunderstorm Wind and Hail: From 1955 through 1992, only tornado, thunderstorm wind and hail events were keyed from the paper publications into digital data. From 1993 to 1995, only tornado, thunderstorm wind and hail events have been extracted from the Unformatted Text Files.

3. All Event Types (48 from Directive 10-1605): From 1996 to present, 48 event types are recorded as defined in NWS Directive 10-1605.

Intro sur le climate change de façon générale

intro sur les états unis et le fait qu'ils ont des évènements météos typiques comme les tornades

> Tornadoes are more typical in the USA than in any other country. The United States experiences the highest number of tornadoes annually, with around 1,200 tornadoes on average each year. This is mainly due to the geography of Tornado Alley, a region in the central U.S. that includes parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Missouri. Here, warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets cool, dry air from Canada, creating the ideal conditions for powerful supercell thunderstorms that spawn tornadoes. While tornadoes do occur in other countries like Canada, Argentina, Bangladesh, and Australia, the U.S. remains the most tornado-prone nation due to its unique climate and geography.

---
1. How does climate change contribute to the increasing frequency of rare weather events in the USA?
2. What are the economic and human consequences of the growing occurrence of extreme weather events?
3. How can statistical analyses of past events help us understand their causes and improve forecasting?

  <p>
    A compelling way to illustrate the evolution of a variable like temperature, while also accounting for geographic variation, is to visualize the map across different years or time periods.

> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
