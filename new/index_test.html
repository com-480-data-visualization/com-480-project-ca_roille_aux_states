    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div id="section-introduction" class="chapter-title">Introduction</div> 
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Climate change is the biggest threat ever experienced by mankind. It refers to the long-term 
        alteration of temperatures and weather patterns and its effects have become more visible as the 
        average temperature of the planet went up by 1.2 °C since the 1800s <a href="#References">[1]</a>. As the Earth warms, 
        it disrupts natural weather systems, contributing to more frequent and extreme weather events. 
        The increasing danger of these events is a serious threat to the safety of many populations. 
        Although addressing climate change requires significant economic and political shifts, we can 
        also focus on better understanding the changes already occurring. The goal of our project is to 
        identify trends and visualize extreme weather events that have taken place, while also assessing 
        their human and economic impacts.
        </p>
        <p>To address our research question, we need relevant data. In this project we will focus on events
        that have happen in the United States. This is because the United States experiences a high number 
        of extreme weather events due to its size and diverse geographical and climatic conditions. But also 
        because of the availability of high-quality data on extreme weather events.Indeed, thanks to 
        the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), we have access to the Storm Events 
        Database <a href="#References">[2]</a>, which provides information on the occurrence of storms and other significant weather 
        phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage,
        and/or disruption to commerce; Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, 
        such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area; Other significant 
        meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that 
        occur in connection with another event. This database spans from January 1950 to November 2024, 
        making it particularly valuable for analyzing the impact of climate change on the frequency of
        extreme weather events.
        </p>
        <p> We will focus on trying to answer questions such as "<i>How does climate change contribute to 
            the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in the USA ?</i>" or "<i>What are the 
            economic and human consequences of the growing occurrence of extreme weather events ?</i>". <br>
        <br>Continue to scroll to start by exploring the current situation of climate change in the United 
        States !

                <p class="panel-description">
                    To understand how the climate change is affecting the extreme weather events we first 
                    need to understand what is the current climate situation in the United States. For that 
                    we start by showing an historical histogram of the average temperature anomalies for the 
                    whole country campared to the 1961-1990 mean average as this is considered, in the scientific
                    litterature, as a good baseline for assessing long term changes [3]. It is obvious 
                    from this histogram that the situation is deteriorating and that all recent years are above the 
                    average.

                <p class="panel-description">
                    Some legitimate question that can come to mind when looking at the first histogram is 
                    whether or not the situation is the same over all the country or if some regions, some states 
                    are more spared by the effect of climate change. To asnwer that question we plot the temperature 
                    anomalies averaged over 2024 but for the different states. It is clear that the climate change problem is affecting more intensly some 
                    state. However, none is spared and everyone should be concerned by the problem.

        We continue our exploration by looking at the historical data of extreme weather events. This is 
        essential to understand the situation in the United States. We start by presenting some plots with general
        statistics that aim to give you a broad overview of which type of events can happen in the United States, 
        at which frequency, and with which impact. However, as our dataset is quite extensive, covering many years,
        many type of events with details concerning economic loss and number of deaths, we are forced to be selective 
        on what we show. However, to give you the posisbility to explore more the data by yourself, you have the 
        possibility, to filter the data by state, range of years, type of events and then choose which information 
        you want to plot and on which type of plot.

                    A first insight on our data is to look at the number of events through the years. 
                    It is very clear that there is more and more events trhough the years, however, this 
                    is due, at least in some way, to the fact that the Storm Events Database has been recensing 
                    more type of events. In particular, only tornadoes were counted in the first phase from 1950 
                    to 1955.

    <div class="text-box">
        As you have maybe found out already above by exploring the data with different kind of plots, 
        the number of extreme weather events is increasing each year. This results in more crop damage,
        deaths and .... This has a huge impact on society in general. To better anticipate future extreme 
        events and mitigate their impact, a better understanding of the factors facilitating the apparition of 
        weather events is essential. This is also necessary to assess what are the consequences of the climate 
        change on the extreme weather freqeuncy. In this part of our exploration we detail other knwon factors 
        influencing the number and the scale of weather events in the United States before actually trying to 
        answer scientifically to whether or not climate change has also an impact and in at what scale.

            <h2 class="plot-title">The topography of the United States</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                One of the most influencing factor, if not the most, of the impressive number and impact of
                extreme weather events in the United States is the topography of the country. As you can see 
                on the topographic map displayed here, the elevation and terrain features vary a lot depending on 
                the regions. Key features visible on this map include mountain peaks, valleys and ridges. How does 
                these variations impact the number of events ? 
                <i>Many factors contribute to the climatology of a given location, including how close to the 
                    equator you are, proximity to the ocean, and elevation. But when it comes to what causes 
                    climate to vary over seemingly short distances, few things can compare to the influence of 
                    topography</i> []. We can not detail everything here and as this is some complex systems, 
                    every factors infulencing extreme weather events is not fully understood by scientists. However, 
                    this text was to remind you that some of the pattern you might have found exploring the data above 
                    can be due to other factors such as topography.

    <!-- <h3>Other factors that influence the number of events</h3> --> 
    <div class="text-box">
        As you have maybe found out already above by exploring the data with different kind of plots, 
        the number of extreme weather events is increasing each year. This results in more crop damage,
        deaths and .... This has a huge impact on society in general. To better anticipate future extreme 
        events and mitigate their impact, a better understanding of the factors facilitating the apparition of 
        weather events is essential. This is also necessary to assess what are the consequences of the climate 
        change on the extreme weather freqeuncy. In this part of our exploration we detail other knwon factors 
        influencing the number and the scale of weather events in the United States before actually trying to 
        answer scientifically to whether or not climate change has also an impact and in at what scale.

    <div class="text-box">
        As we have seen with these data and visualizations, it is clear that climate change has a role in 
        the increasing number of events even though it is not the only factors. However, climate change 
        has other consequences and since it is increasily costly both economicaly and in terms of deaths and
        casulties, it is necessary to take quick and impactful actions to both mitigate its consequences as well 
        as reducing emissions to diminish the future anomalies.
