        We continue our exploration by looking at the historical data of extreme weather events. This is 
        essential to understand the situation in the United States. We start by presenting some plots with general
        statistics that aim to give you a broad overview of which type of events can happen in the United States, 
        at which frequency, and with which impact. However, as our dataset is quite extensive, covering many years,
        many type of events with details concerning economic loss and number of deaths, we are forced to be selective 
        on what we show. However, to give you the posisbility to explore more the data by yourself, you have the 
        possibility, to filter the data by state, range of years, type of events and then choose which information 
        you want to plot and on which type of plot.

                <p class="panel-description">
                    To understand how the climate change is affecting the extreme weather events we first 
                    need to understand what is the current climate situation in the United States. For that 
                    we start by showing an historical histogram of the average temperature anomalies for the 
                    whole country campared to the 1961-1990 mean average as this is considered, in the scientific
                    litterature, as a good baseline for assessing long term changes  [ref WMO]. It is obvious 
                    from this histogram that the situation is deteriorating and that all recent years are above the 
                    average.

                <p class="panel-description">
                    Some legitimate question that can come to mind when looking at the first histogram is 
                    whether or not the situation is the same over all the country or if some regions, some states 
                    are more spared by the effect of climate change. To asnwer that question we plot the same temperature 
                    anomalies for the year 2024 but for different state of the United States. It is clear that the climate change problem is affecting more intensly some 
                    state. However, none is spared and everyone should be concerned by the problem.

                    Another question that comes to mind when looking at these different data is to know how it would 
                    be in the future. For that we answer with some strip lines plot showing how the temperature anomaly 
                    is increasing or not depending on different scenarios, typically ranging from concrete actions to mitigate 
                    climate change to none. It is evident that if we want to mitigate climate change some ....

    <div class="grey-text-box">
        As you have maybe found out already above by exploring the data with different kind of plots, 
        the number of extreme weather events is increasing each year. This results in more crop damage,
        deaths and .... This has a huge impact on society in general. To better anticipate future extreme 
        events and mitigate their impact, a better understanding of the factors facilitating the apparition of 
        weather events is essential. This is also necessary to assess what are the consequences of the climate 
        change on the extreme weather freqeuncy. In this part of our exploration we detail other knwon factors

                This topographic map displays detailed elevation data and terrain features of the selected region. 
                The contour lines indicate changes in elevation, with closer lines representing steeper terrain 
                and wider spacing indicating gentler slopes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key features visible on this map include mountain peaks, valleys, ridges, and water bodies. 
                The color gradients and shading help visualize the three-dimensional landscape on a 
                two-dimensional surface, making it easier to understand the terrain's characteristics.

        As you have maybe found out already above by exploring the data with different kind of plots, 
        the number of extreme weather events is increasing each year. This results in more crop damage,
        deaths and .... This has a huge impact on society in general. To better anticipate future extreme 
        events and mitigate their impact, a better understanding of the factors facilitating the apparition of 
        weather events is essential. This is also necessary to assess what are the consequences of the climate 
        change on the extreme weather freqeuncy. In this part of our exploration we detail other knwon factors

    <div class="grey-text-box">
        As we have seen with these data and visualizations, it is clear that climate change has a role in 
        the increasing number of events even though it is not the only factors. However, climate change 
        has other consequences and since it is increasily costly both economicaly and in terms of deaths and
        casulties, it is necessary to take quick and impactful actions to both mitigate its consequences as well 
        as reducing emissions to diminish the future anomalies.
